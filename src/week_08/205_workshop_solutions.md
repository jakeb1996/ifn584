## Design exercises

---
#### Exercise A

The following class diagram defines the classes and their relationships. Notice that:
- Inheritance is used to derive `Student` and `Professor` from `Person`.
- The `Course` class _composes_ one or more `Assignment` objects. This indicates that an assignment is part of a course, and its life cycle is tightly bound to that of the course.
- The `Registration` class links a `Student` with a `Course`.

}

' Inheritance
Person <|-- Student
Person <|-- Professor

' Association relationships
Student "1" --> "0..*" Registration : registers
Course "1" --> "0..*" Registration : registers

' Composition: Course contains Assignments
Course *--> "0..*" Assignment : contains

' Association: Professor teaches Courses
Professor "1" --> "0..*" Course : teaches

#### Exercise B

###### Object Diagram 1: Student Course Registration

```plantuml-svg
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontSize 15
skinparam backgroundColor white
skinparam object {
    BackgroundColor white
}

object "john : Professor" {
  EmployeeId = 101
  Department = "Computer Science"
  CoursesTeaching = [courseCS101]
  Name = "John Doe"
  Email = "j.doe@university.edu"
}

object "courseCS101 : Course" {
  CourseCode = "CS101"
  Title = "Introduction to Computer Science"
  Description = "Fundamentals of CS"
  Assignments = [assign1]
  Registrations = [regi1]
  Instruct = john
}

object "assign1 : Assignment" {
  Title = "Assignment 1"
  Description = "Intro to programming"
  DueDate = "2025-05-01"
}

object "alice : Student" {
  StudentId = 201
  Name = "Alice Smith"
  Email = "a.smith@student.university.edu"
  Registrations = [regi1]
}

object "regi1 : Registration" {
  student = alice
  course = courseCS101
  Grade = "Not Graded"
}

' Showing composition and associations
"courseCS101 : Course" -- "assign1 : Assignment" : contains
"courseCS101 : Course" -- "john : Professor" : taught by
"alice : Student" -- "regi1 : Registration" : registration
"regi1 : Registration" -- "courseCS101 : Course" : for course

###### Object Diagram 2: Professor Managing Multiple Courses

```plantuml-svg
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontSize 15
skinparam backgroundColor white
skinparam object {
    BackgroundColor white
}

object "jane : Professor" {
  EmployeeId = 102
  Department = "Mathematics"
  CoursesTeaching = [courseMATH201,courseMATH202]
  Name = "Jane Doe"
  Email = "j.doe@university.edu"
}

object "courseMATH201 : Course" {
  CourseCode = "MATH201"
  Title = "Calculus II"
  Description = "Advanced calculus topics"
  Assignments = [assignCalc]
  Registrations = [alice,...]
  Instruct = jane
}

object "assignCalc : Assignment" {
  Title = "Integration Techniques"
  Description = "Practice integration methods"
  DueDate = "2025-06-15"
}

object "courseMATH202 : Course" {
  CourseCode = "MATH202"
  Title = "Linear Algebra"
  Description = "Matrix theories and applications"
  Assignments = [assignMatrix]
  Registrations = [bob,...]
  Instruct = jane
}

object "assignMatrix : Assignment" {
  Title = "Matrix Operations"
  Description = "Solve matrix problems"
  DueDate = "2025-06-20"
}

' Create composition relationships
"courseMATH201 : Course" -- "assignCalc : Assignment" : contains
"courseMATH202 : Course" -- "assignMatrix : Assignment" : contains

' Associate professor with courses
"jane : Professor" -- "courseMATH201 : Course" : teaches
"jane : Professor" -- "courseMATH202 : Course" : teaches

#### Exercise C

###### Sequence Diagram 1: Student Course Registration


```plantuml-svg
@startuml
hide footbox
skinparam defaultFontSize 14
skinparam backgroundColor white
skinparam participant {
    BackgroundColor white
}

actor "Actor" as StudentActor
participant "alice : Student" as stu
participant "regi : Registration" as reg
participant "course : Course" as crs

StudentActor -> stu: RegisterForCourse(course)
activate stu
stu --> reg: new Registration(alice, course)
activate reg
reg -> stu: return regi
deactivate reg
stu -> crs: AddRegistration(regi)
activate crs
deactivate crs

stu -> stu: AddRegistration(regi)
activate stu
deactivate stu
@enduml
```

**Explanation:**

- The actor (for Student) initiates a call on its own `RegisterForCourse` method.
- The Student creates a new `Registration` object associating itself with the Course.
- The Student then adds the newly created Registration to the Courseâ€™s list.
- Finally, student adds the newly created Registration to its own list.
###### Sequence Diagram 2: Professor Posting an Assignment

```plantuml-svg
@startuml
hide footbox
skinparam defaultFontSize 14
skinparam backgroundColor white
skinparam participant {
    BackgroundColor white
}

actor "Actor" as ProfessorActor
participant "john : Professor" as prof
participant "assign : Assignment" as asgn
participant "course : Course" as crs

ProfessorActor --> asgn: new Assignment("Assignment 1", "Intro to programming", new DateTime(2025, 5, 1))
activate asgn
asgn -> ProfessorActor: return assign
deactivate asgn
ProfessorActor -> prof: CreateAssignment(course, assign)
activate prof
prof -> crs: AddAssignment(assign)
activate crs
deactivate crs
deactivate prof
@enduml
```

**Explanation:**
- The actor (for Professor) creates a new Assignment.
- Then, the actor triggers the `CreateAssignment` operation on the Professor object, providing the target Course and the newly created Assignment.
- Next, the Professor instructs the target Course to add the Assignment via its `AddAssignment` method.
